# personal-website
A personal website I created as a home assignment for a university course, using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 

To run my website, simply double-click on index.html.

My input validation:
When the type of input was not choosing an option from given options,
I explicitly demanded a specific type of input. For example: number, email address and text.
The only time I asked for text input was when I asked for the user's full name.
In that case, I used the input pattern attribute to make sure I don't receive any malicious input.

The purpose of the JavaScript code in my website is increasing the user's interaction on it.
I tried to make it look like the website responds to the user's actions.
I did that by creating functions for features such as:
gradually revealed text, a responsive navigation bar, optional background music, and more.
